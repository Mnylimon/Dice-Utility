# Dev 1

For my dev1 I decided to rework and improve my dev0 project.
Some of the problems I ran into early on got worked on individually
like my week 10 learn together being the concept that I initially
scrapped because of the struggle I had implementing it with
dictionaries. But after alot of struggles I figured it out.

That being said I feel like I got a bit too ambitious but I am 
satisfied with what my dev1 project ended up being. I ran into 
tons of bug on this one and some of them were on another level. I was able to
work around many of those bugs but there was one in particular
that was beyond my grasps. Though it wasn't program ending and rather very tiny.
That being said I was able to learn alot during this dev1 project
since I had to do alot of self research to solve alot of the bugs I
encountered with dictionaries. Overall I am pretty satisfied and happy
with how my dev1 turned out.

Also I'm not sure how to make the flowchart appear in the readme.md file.
