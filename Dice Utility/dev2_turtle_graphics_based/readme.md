# Dev 2

For my dev 2 I decided to refactor my dev 1 into OOP and integrate it
into Turtle Graphics. I feel like I did a good job but it could've
been better. Working with Turtle was a struggle. I was met with wall
after wall and was a bit annoyed at the limitations I came across.
I was kind of sad that I wasn't able to implement my custom dice
feature because of the large limitation of turtle I discovered. Which
was making a custom dice entirely through Turtle would mean that a
majority of my code would have to be in the main.py due to inputs and
popups being limited to the Screen class. It was pretty hard and that
was the one feature of my dev 1 that was cut due to time constrains.
Other than that, I will say that I am impressed with myself on how
I was able to implement everything into turtle. Not a single output
was sent to the terminal. I got everything working and got it all to
work with mouse clicks through turtle. I had to do alot of extensive
research to figure out mouse clicks how they worked in turtle. My
research kind of disappointed me because there really wasn't that
much answers online. I was surprised when I was trying to see if
I could make turtle objects be transparent but still clickable
because I was able to find nothing and it baffled me how turtle
didn't have rgba support when some people suggested rgba online 
to get transparent colors. I was even more surprised when I found out
the whole topic of transparent turtles took me to a forum in 2013 - 2014
that discussed if turtle would ever get rgba support.

Other than hard implementation of turtle, I liked this project. I was
able to see how much I learned in this class and put the concepts and 
skills I learned to the test.
