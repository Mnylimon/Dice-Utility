# Dev 0

For the dev 0 I wanted to make a game of sorts or something that could be used with games.
I originally was planning to make a video game version of my week4 learn together but
decided against it because I remembered that I wanted to make a dice program. I made the
dice program and added some utility to it like being able to add a specific amount to the
current roll or to reduce the amount in the roll. I also added an option to get the sum of
all the rolls you currently did in the session you had in the program before closing it.
I also gave multiple dice options. I had to do a little research about functions and global
variables but I think the dev0 project I made is pretty cool.
