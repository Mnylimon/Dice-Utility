# dice-utility
Personal Dice Project made in Python from (CIT95) at Fresno City College
Decided to move it to my personal github since it was only visible to me and my instructor
in the class organization

There is 3 versions of the project since I was building upon it with each version.
I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish with this project and will 
probably revisit this project and it's concept in the future.
